# Project Woodhouse
## Introduction
This project was created to address the issues with synchronizing work between individuals when working with resources that should preferably have only one person working with them at a time. For example when multiple people were working on end user documentations that is under source control, there would be times when work could be overwritten, merged incorrectly, etc. Another example is where two or more developers would work on the same area of code, once they are done with their work they would have to merge their changes and hope that the merge did not cause problems.

Synchronizing these resources would often lead to messaging or talking with one another to determine if a resource was occupied and by whom, messaging or talking again when the resource was freed, and so on. Rather than wasting time waiting on responses to check on resources, it was decided to create an app to better handle synchronizing between team members. Thus project Woodhouse was born out of this necessity and for the desire to play with different technologies outside of those used in the workplace.
